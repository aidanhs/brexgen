https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign
  implementation of rsa signing in JS
  unfortunately hashing doesn't seem to be able to handle escaped js strings (?)
  and doesn't handle blobs
  public key generation is outside the scope of the library

  someone has already done what I'm doing!
https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge
  a very complete js crypto library. includes signing and public key generation

Note
* The SHA1 implementation has been lifted from the Google Closure Library. It (and the minor modifications and helper functions) are under the Apache Licence, Version 2.0.
* Paul Johnston's Javascript hashing implementations (included in jsrsasign) have been removed as they don't appear to work reliably in this use case.
